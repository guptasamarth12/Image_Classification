# Image_Classification

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for binary image classification.

# Features

- Utilizes a CNN architecture to achieve high accuracy in classifying cat and dog images.
- Supports training and testing phases with a clear dataset split.
- Includes data preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Provides evaluation metrics like accuracy and loss curves for better model insights.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy

# Model Architecture

The CNN model includes the following layers:

  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
  - Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
  - Fully connected layers for classification.
  - Output layer with a softmax or sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
